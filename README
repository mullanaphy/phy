TODO

+ Decouple classes and incorporate dependency injections.
+ Replace linked Debug::error messages to more generic throw new Exceptions. This way classes are more mobile.
+ Continue to remove hard coded Singletons with dependency or setter injections while using the Registry for default values.
+ Add the JavaScript back into this project. Either jQuery or my personal 'in development' framework.
